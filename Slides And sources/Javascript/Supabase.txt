Supabase automatically provides a RESTful API for every table in your database, powered by PostgREST. You can access it using standard HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) or the specific Supabase client libraries, which are generally recommended. 
Accessing the API
To call a table as an API, you need your project's unique URL and an API key: 
Find your Project URL: In your Supabase Dashboard, go to Settings > API. The URL will look like https://<project_ref>.supabase.co.
Find your API Key: In the same Settings > API section, copy the anon (public) key for client-side operations or the service_role key for server-side operations (which bypasses Row Level Security). 
Using the API with HTTP Requests (REST) 
You can make direct HTTP calls to the API endpoints: 
Endpoint structure: https://<project_ref>.supabase.co/rest/v1/<table_name>.
Headers required:
apikey: Your anon or service_role key.
Authorization: Bearer <Your API Key> (same value as the apikey header). 
Examples using the REST API:
Retrieve all rows (GET):
http
GET https://<project_ref>.supabase.co/rest/v1/your_table_name
apikey: YOUR_API_KEY
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Insert a new row (POST):
http
POST https://<project_ref>.supabase.co/rest/v1/your_table_name
apikey: YOUR_API_KEY
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "column_name": "value",
  "another_column": "another_value"
}

apikey: YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
